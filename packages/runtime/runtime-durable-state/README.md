# @tiny-json-workflow/runtime-durable-state

This package is a local fork of the core logic from the [tiny-workflow](https://github.com/tinnguyenhuuletrong/tiny-workflow) repository.

It provides the `DurableState` class and the core runtime for executing stateful, durable workflows. This forked version is maintained within this monorepo to allow for easier modifications and extensions specific to the `tiny-json-workflow` project.
